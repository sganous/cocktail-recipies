	<p>Alternate twist on a sour cocktail.</p>
	<p>
		A very sweet and refreshing drink for easy sipping on a summer day.<br/>
		This drink is thought to have come up during the prohibition period of the United States.<br/>
		During those times, there was a lot of questionable liquor roaming the shelves, so this<br/>
		drink was created to help mask some of the unpleasantries that could arise, coining the ironic<br/>
		name of the "Bee's Knees". Regarless of intent, the floral pallet of gin pairs wonderfully with<br/>
		lemon and honey.
